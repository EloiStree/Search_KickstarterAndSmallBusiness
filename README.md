# Search_KickstarterAndSmallBusiness

I am coded tool to listen to:
- MIDI input (Music standard)
- DirectInput (Joystick and devices)
- XInput (xbox)  
- UDP (to allows bridge between other)  

My plan is to read standard and build bridge that allows people to hook to the toolboxes of OMI in aim to allows anyone or any project to easy the use of macro and keystroke simulation.  
  
So if you see a kickstarter or a project that you bought, will received, and that you want to make it compatible with OMI.
